##AUTHOR
* Lucy Karimi

##PROJECT DESCRIPTION
*  The caesar-Cipher program is a program that ciphers text to a form of scrammbled words. Caesar-Cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
